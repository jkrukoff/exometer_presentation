# Who Am I?

John Krukoff

* 20 years of development experience.
* Started experimenting with Erlang 5 years ago.
* Just put my first Erlang system into production.

# Why Metrics?

* Observability!
* Real time view of the state of the system.

---
class: middle

# Constraints

* An existing Erlang system that reported via Folsom to hosted Graphite.
* Needs to be in a format that Telegraf (from the InfluxDB stack) supports.

---
class: middle

# Reporting Libraries

* Folsom
* Various statsd libraries
* Exometer

# Introduction to Exometer

* Define your metrics via code or configuration.
* Update metrics in your application code.
* Report metrics via reporter subscriptions.

Turns out there's an
[exometer_core](https://github.com/Feuerlabs/exometer_core) library and an
[exometer](https://github.com/Feuerlabs/exometer) library that wraps it. This
became important later.

# Defining Metrics

In code (in application:start/2):

```erlang
exometer:new([sys, erlang, process_count], gauge).
```

In configuration (in sys.config):

```erlang
[
  {exometer, [{predefined,
               [{[sys, erlang, process_count], gauge, []}]},
]
```

```erlang
[
  {your_app, [{exometer_predefined,
               [{[sys, erlang, process_count], gauge, []}]},
]
```

Lots of options!

# Updating Metrics

```erlang
ok = exometer:update([sys, erlang, process_count],
                     erlang:system_info(process_count)).
```

Behaviour depends on the declared type of the metric.

# Reporting Metrics

Declare a reporter (in sys.config).

```erlang
{exometer, [
  {report,
    [{reporters,
      [{exometer_report_graphite, [{connect_timeout, 60000},
                                   {prefix, "${GRAPHITE_PREFIX}"},
                                   {host, "${GRAPHITE_HOST}"},
                                   {port, 2003},
                                   {api_key, "${GRAPHITE_API_KEY}"}]}
      ]},
```

Then declare a subscriber to send metrics to the reporter.

```erlang
     {subscribers,
      [{select, {[{'_', [], ['$_']}], exometer_report_graphite, value, 60000}}
      ]}
    ]}
  ]}
```

Like metric definitions, can also be done in code.

# What Went Wrong?

![Fail](fail.gif)

---
class: middle

# Exometer Packaging

* There's no exometer hex.pm package.
* It has a *lot* of dependencies, and those dependencies don't build with recent releases.

Fortunately, there's exometer_core.

---
class: middle

# Exometer Core

* No built in reporters.
* Graphite reporter is in exometer.
* hex.pm package is [maintained by a 3rd party](https://github.com/Feuerlabs/exometer_core/issues/69).
* At least it builds without custom patches.

Reporter issues are annoying, but I can fix that...

* [https://hex.pm/packages/exometer_report_lager](https://hex.pm/packages/exometer_report_lager)
* [https://hex.pm/packages/exometer_report_graphite](https://hex.pm/packages/exometer_report_graphite)

# Exometer Documentation

Not great.

A particular challenge was figuring out the subscriber match specification.
It's helpful to know what *match everything* looks like:

```erlang
{select, [{'_', [], ['$_']}], ...}
```

# Metric Names

* Pretty long.
* Everything explodes if you misspell the name.

Decided to declare them as macros to get some compile time checking of the
names.

```erlang
%%%-------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% Macro definitions for metric names.
%%%-------------------------------------------------------------------

-define(METRIC_POLLED, [ingest, sqs, polled]).
-define(METRIC_RECEIVED, [ingest, sqs, received]).
-define(METRIC_PARSED, [ingest, notifications, parsed]).
-define(METRIC_PARSE_FAILED, [ingest, notifications, parse_failed]).
-define(METRIC_DELETED, [ingest, sqs, deleted]).
-define(METRIC_DELETE_FAILED, [ingest, sqs, delete_failed]).
```

# Tests

How to declare metrics for tests?

Move them into a module:

```erlang
{exometer_predefined, {apply, my_metrics, config, []}}
```

And use same module in test setup:

```erlang
setup_test() ->
    ok = exometer:start(),
    {ok, ExometerConfig} = my_metrics:config(),
    ok = lists:foreach(fun _Unpack({Name, Type, Opts}) ->
                           ok = exometer:new(Name, Type, Opts)
                       end, ExometerConfig).
```

# VM Metrics

It's just more metrics to collect, right?
